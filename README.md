Ever want to go on a weekend trip, but you're not sure where to go?  Not sure what to prioritize, if you only have two or three days?
My site was designed to resolve this porblem.  Travelers can submit recommended destinations optimal for different periods of time, and the type of trip, whether it be a romantic weekend, a family trip, or a bachelor/bachelorette party.
They can also submit itineraries to let you know how they focused their short trip, estimated price points, and more.
